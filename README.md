This is an analysis on data gathered from reddit, slack, and facebook on the Median Money Game. The game is to pick an amount of money,
one which you will recieve if most other players pick a higher number than you.
Guesses followed an interesting log scale, with the median falling on $40,000.
Respondents were also asked a number of other questions for further analysis.
